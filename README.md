<h1>Tax Calculation Form</h1>
This project implements a tax calculation form using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The form allows users to input their gross annual income, extra income, deductions, and age to calculate their tax liability based on specific criteria.

Features
Tax Calculation: The form calculates tax based on the provided inputs according to the following rules:

If the overall income (after deductions) is under 8 Lakhs, no tax is applied.
For income over 8 Lakhs, the amount over 8 Lakhs is taxed at different rates based on age:
30% for individuals under 40 years old
40% for individuals aged 40 to 59
10% for individuals aged 60 or above
Error Handling:

Error icons are displayed next to input fields if incorrect values are entered, and hovering over them shows error messages.
Age input is mandatory, and an error icon is displayed if it is not selected.
Modal Display:

Upon form submission, a modal displays the calculated tax amount.
Requirements
